# BellyButton-Biology

## Overview
There is a completed panel for demographic information and now it needs to be able to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.

## Deliverables:
Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart

## Create a Horizontal Bar Chart:
This displays the top 10 bacterial species (OTUs) when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu on the webpage. The horizontal bar chart will display the sample_values as the values, the otu_ids as the labels, and the otu_labels as the hover text for the bars on the chart.

## Create a Bubble Chart:
This displays the following when an individual’s ID is selected from the dropdown menu webpage:
* The otu_ids as the x-axis values.
* The sample_values as the y-axis values.
* The sample_values as the marker size.
* The otu_ids as the marker colors.
* The otu_labels as the hover-text values.

## Create a Gauge Chart
This displays the weekly washing frequency's value and the value as a measure from 0-10 on the progress bar in the gauge chart when an individual ID is selected from the dropdown menu.
